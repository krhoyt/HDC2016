# Heartland Developer Conference 2016

*September 7 - 9, 2016*

Workshop: [Introduction to Deep Learning with IBM Watson](https://aimhdc2016.sched.org/event/7LIk?iframe=no)

What is the price of not knowing? Every day we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data, and 90% of the data in the world has been generated in the past two years alone. There are 7.3 billion people connected to the Internet around the world, creating 1.7 megabytes of data every minute. Unstructured data - dark data - accounts for 80% of all data generated today. Like dark matter, which cannot be seen, we know dark data exists by its impact (or lack thereof) on our industries. 

This is the dawn of the cognitive era - an inflection point that occurs once about every 40 years - that lends itself to machine learning. In this workshop, join IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, and go hands on with IBM Watson. Learn about APIs such as text-to-speech, and speech-to-text, translation, image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), concept and personality insights, and more. Leave with a new toolkit to help you leverage deep learning, and to solve the problems your industry faces.

Session: [Introducing Node-RED for Faster Development](https://aimhdc2016.sched.org/event/7M0d?iframe=no)

If you have been programming long enough, you know that certain patterns emerge, and that work often gets wrapped in boilerplate code.  An example would be CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a database, that you might expose via an API.  Sending an email or text message.  What if you could develop, design, and orchestrate business logic using visual tooling? 

Node-RED is an open source visual tool for wiring together business logic, built on Node.js.  Expose API endpoints via drag-and-drop.  Consume APIs in the same way.  Access databases, email server, Watson cognitive services, Twitter feeds, and more in a browser-based tool that allows you to visual control the flow of logic.  IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, takes you on a tour of the tool that may just revolutionize how you work, with increased productivity, and faster time to market.
